TODO
----

  - proper error reporting
  - record usage counts and dates for entries in the cache, so we can
    automatically clean them up.
  - make sure each public type's interface is defined by a trait.
  - `Cache::get()` needs a callback to report download progress.
  - if `Cache::get()` updates the locally cached data, it should
    delete the file containing the stale data.
  - Add support for other caching-relevant headers, like Expires
    or Cache-Control.
  - Support "freshness", so we can sometimes answer from the cache
    without having to talk to the remote server at all.
  - Add support for limiting cache size,
    so we automatically remove old data if the cache gets too big.
