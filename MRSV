At the time of this commit, the minimum apparently supported rust is 1.33.0

This is due to mime_guess v2.0.0 using the "import <> as _" syntax, which was stabilized
in rust 1.33.0

mime_guess >= v2.0.0 is required by reqwest v0.9.9

reqwest >= v0.9.9 is required by static-http-cache v0.2.0

All these versions and the required lockfiles for working with 1.33.0 are available
in the `ancient-vendor-sources` branch.
